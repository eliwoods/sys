# sys
A collection of settings and dot files for setting up new Apple systems

# Install
Assuming you're on a new machine, installation is as simple as can be:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:eliwoods/sys.git ~/.sys_config
sh ~/.sys_config/setup.sh
```

This will run all shell related setup. I suggest installing iTerm and PyCharm
manually since there can be some compatability issues depending on the OS version
and I don't want to solve that progamatically. Sorry...

* iTerm
  * [Download](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html)
  * [Import settings](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66923620/18052495)
    * Note that this can be done progamatically, but given the version issues
      I've run into I'm only showing the manual approach.
* PyCharm
  * [Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac)
    * Note that professional is required to import settings and generally worth the price IMO
